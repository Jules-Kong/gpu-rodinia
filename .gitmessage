# NOTE:
# 1. Each line of the submission message should be no longer than 80 characters.
# 2. For the ventus-gogpu architecture, "TARGET" is recommended to use "VENTUS".
# 3. "FOOTER PART" is optional and is generally required when citing open source
# submissions, but not required for self-developed code.


### Here's an example
#
# [ventus][RISCV] Use constant pool for large integers
#
# For large integers (for example, magic numbers generated by
# TargetLowering::BuildSDIV when dividing by constant), we may
# need about 4~8 instructions to build them.
# In the same time, it just takes two instructions to load
# constants (with extra cycles to access memory), so it may be
# profitable to put these integers into constant pool.
